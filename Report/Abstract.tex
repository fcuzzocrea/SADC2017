The following report describes the procedure and the mathematical models used to simulate the behavior a 6U CubeSat in a LEO orbit.
The sensor installed on the CubeSat to perform attitude determination are a tri-axial magnetometer and three single axis gyroscopes. 
The actuators installed on the CubeSat to perform attitude contro are three magnetic torquers and a reaction wheel.
