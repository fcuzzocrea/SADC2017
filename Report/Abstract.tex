The following report will contain the procedure and the mathematical models used to simulate the behaviour a 6U Cubesat in a LEO orbit.
The sensor installed on the cubesat are a tri-axial magnetometer and a tri-axial gyroscope. 
The actuators installed on the cubesat to control the attitude are 3 magnetic torquers and a reaction wheel.

The latest version of the simulator can be found at : https://github.com/fcuzzocrea/SADC2017
